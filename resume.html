<h1> About Me </h1>
</div>

<div class=experience>
<p>I do a variety of freelance work, working on projects with incredibly varied subjects and styles.</p>

<p>I currently work as a multimedia producer for the <a href="https://www.carnegie.org/">Carnegie Corporation of New York</a>, creating multimedia stories about the foundation's grantees.</p> 

<p>Prior to that, I was a freelance video producer for two years. 
I worked on a range of projects during that time, including a video about a comedian for <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/making-money-the-comedian">The New Yorker</a>, a series of videos for Sotheby's called <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/videos/2015/05/behind-the-collector-michael-phillips-moskowitz.html">Behind the Collector</a>, and short video profile of a cam girl for <a href="http://www.seeker.com/what-being-a-cam-girl-is-really-like-1533259134.html">Discovery Digital</a>. I'm currently collaborating on an interactive documentary focusing on stories of sexual assault.</p>

I grew up in California's Mojave Desert, but I now call New York City home. <br>
<br>If I could take all the bodega cats home with me, I would.
