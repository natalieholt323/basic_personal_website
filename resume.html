		<h1> About Me </h1>

	</div>


	<p>I do a variety of freelance work, working on projects with incredibly varied subjects and styles.</p>

	<p>I currently work as a multimedia producer for the <a href="https://www.carnegie.org/">Carnegie Corporation of New York</a>, creating multimedia stories about the foundation's grantees.</p>

	<h3> Video Producing </h3>
	</div>

	<p>Prior to Carnegie, I was a freelance video producer for two years. I worked on a range of projects during that time, including a video about a comedian for <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/making-money-the-comedian">The New Yorker</a>, a series of videos for Sotheby's called <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/videos/2015/05/behind-the-collector-michael-phillips-moskowitz.html">Behind the Collector</a>, a short video profile of a cam girl for <a href="http://www.seeker.com/what-being-a-cam-girl-is-really-like-1533259134.html">Discovery Digital</a>, and a series of short videos for the just launched <a href="http://12kindsofkindness.com/about/">12 Kinds of Kindness</a>. I'm currently collaborating on an interactive documentary focusing on stories of sexual assault.</p>

	<h4> <u> <b>Multimedia </u> </b> </h4>

	<p> I've also worked as an editor and producer for several web-based publications. </p>

	<p> Earlier this year I oversaw photo editing and art direction for O'Reilly Media's new website.</p>
	
	<p>Before that, I was a multimedia editor for a short-lived magazine called CRETUS. I shot the print cover and multiple print and online features and oversaw all photo editorial operations. In my subsequent role as multimedia
	editor, I established CRETUS's online video presence, creating and commissioning short visual stories.</p>
	
	<p>A little bit more about me: I grew up in California's Mojave Desert, but I now call New York City home. 
	<br>If I could take all the bodega cats home with me, I would.
