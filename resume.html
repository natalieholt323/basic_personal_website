I do a variety of freelance work, working on projects with incredibly varied subjects and styles, and I love finding fellow collaborators. So if you think we'd be a good match, get in touch!

 Recently I shot a produced some videos for for Sotheby's called Behind the Collector, shot a video for Taste Talks Brooklyn, produced a video for a chic plus-size clothing brand, and co-produced a video about a comedian for The New Yorker's “Making Money” series. 

Currently I'm working on a short documentary for Discovery Digital about cam girls, and I'm collaborating on an interactive documentary focusing on stories of sexual assault. 

I grew up in California's Mojave Desert, but I now call NYC home. If I could take all the bodega cats home with me, I would.
