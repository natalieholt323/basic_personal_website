<div class=experience>
<p>I do a variety of freelance work, working on projects with incredibly varied subjects and styles.</p>

<p>I currently work as a multimedia producer for the <a href="https://www.carnegie.org/">Carnegie Corporation of New York</a>, creating multimedia stories about the foundation's grantees.</p> 

Video Producing 
<p>Prior to that, I was a freelance video producer for two years. 
I worked on a range of projects during that time, including a video about a comedian for <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/making-money-the-comedian">The New Yorker</a>, a series of videos for Sotheby's called <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/videos/2015/05/behind-the-collector-michael-phillips-moskowitz.html">Behind the Collector</a>, and short video profile of a cam girl for <a href="http://www.seeker.com/what-being-a-cam-girl-is-really-like-1533259134.html">Discovery Digital</a>. I'm currently collaborating on an interactive documentary focusing on stories of sexual assault.</p>
Little Red Summers. New York, NY.
Videographer/Editor. June 2014-August 2014.
Shot and edited 2-3 short videos per week for a summer camp. Maintained database of all video footage, worked collaboratively
while independently self-managing. Took initiative to go beyond standard montage format to create short videos with interviews.
NYU TV & Media Services. New York, NY.
Freelance Producer. January 2014-Present
I shoot and edit videos on an as-needed basis for NYU TV, a resource for broadcast quality video for the NYU community. I liaise
with university media departments to ensure that audio and visual needs of events are met, and organize and set up all aspects of
production, including live-streaming and live-switching. Took initiative to assist managing media spaces in EditShare.

Multimedia 
I've also worked as an editor and producer for several web-based publications. 
earlier this year I oversaw photo editing and art direction for O'Reilly Media's new website.
Before that, I was a multimedia editor for a short-lived magazine called CRETUS.
Shot the print cover and multiple print and online features and oversaw all photo editorial operations. In my subsequent role as multimedia
editor, I established CRETUSâ€™s online video presence, creating and commissioning short visual stories.

I grew up in California's Mojave Desert, but I now call New York City home. <br>
<br>If I could take all the bodega cats home with me, I would.
